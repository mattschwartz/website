                    <p>
                        I am a computer science major at the University of Texas at Austin. Computer science is not just 
                        a career choice for me; it is my passion. Outside of class projects and coding assignments, I 
                        frequently enjoy working on projects of my own. Since my first computer science course in high 
                        school, I have developed dozens of applications of various size, from small "proof of 
                        concept" programs to <a href="projects/java/stonequest/">StoneQuest</a>, the largest Java application I have assumed 
                        alone with, at last count, ~13,000 lines of source code.

                    <h2>Education</h2>

                    <p>
                        I studied computer science for two years at <a href="http://www.letu.edu/">LeTourneau University</a>
                        in east Texas before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin in the spring of 2012. I
                        plan to graduate in 2014 after which I intend to pursue a master's degree in the same field.

                    <p>
                        I consider myself proficient in the following programming languages.

                        <li>C++</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I have also become reasonably familiar with Perl, Lisp and SQL during my studies at UT.

                    <p>
                        Through both the classes I have taken in college as well as my own curiosity, I have developed
                        interests in many areas of computer science; notably,
