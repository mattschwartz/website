                            taken to show others a specific feature that I would

                        <p>
                            I have created a simple, interactive display for viewing the changes I plan to make to
                            StoneQuest's interface in the future using some basic JavaScript. You can view it for yourself

                        Looking through past screenshots, you will find that the most noticeable changes have been to
                        the interface. Through development, I have slowly started to see what I want the final product
                        to be and as this happens, I see how the interface should evolve to meet that vision.

                        The above screenshot is from an old code base that I have not worked on since January 2012 when
                        the spring semester began. The game never progressed beyond the point of movement, the features
                        visible were for display only and the player could not interact with them. Picking the project 
                        back up again in July 2012, I started over with new goals in mind.
                    </p>

                        A short 100 hours after starting fresh, I had a fully functional, albeit shallow, game. The 
                        features in the above screenshot were working: the player could upgrade his stats, use, drop and
                        pick up items, attack monsters and collect currency in the form of gold. The only area in which
                        the game was lacking was content &ndash; there was only a rat for montsers, no quests, bland
                        items and no world. Looking back, this simple interface still pleases me and I feel a game could 
                        be built from it. But I wanted more from a game that up to that point already consumed tens of
                        hours of my life.

                    <p>
                        After hundreds of hours later, spread across six months, I had finally implemented a richer 
                        interface with 2D graphics to StoneQuest. It was at this point I decided what was truly lacking
                        was mouse support. I had originally intended on programming the game to be a true roguelike
                        game that simply had improved graphics. Adding mouse support took the game in an entirely 
                        different direction for me.

                        So now here we are today, July 21, 2013, a year and a half since I started this project back in
                        December 2011. Every inch of the interface has been altered since then, and after countless 
                        hours designing and implementing this interface... I am still not satisfied. In early June 2013,
                        I began work on redesigning StoneQuest's interface, from the ground up. I have ignored coding
                        until I have finished the design of the interface to ensure elements fit together perfectly. I
                        have spent the past month and a half working on the interface and I am nearly finished.

                        The screenshot shows several windows open: the player's inventory (right), the item upgrade 
                        interface (left) and the brewing window (center). The text box in the lower center portion is 
                        the information log, where game updates are relayed via text to the player. The black box to
                        the left of the window icons on the lower right is a tooltip box where information about what
                        the player's cursor is hovering over is displayed. Finally, the lower left area, where a candle
                        is burning bright, represents how much health the player has. I am still toying with this idea,
                        so it is far from permanent.

                    <h2>Crafting</h2>

                    <p>
                        In all the games I have played over the years, a rich and rewarding crafting system has been one
                        of my favorite elements of gaming; so naturally, StoneQuest will have a crafting system. I plan
                        to try and take all the best crafting system features from other games when designing my own 
                        system. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A very important feature of the system will be the ability to upgrade items; and every item in 
                        the game can be upgraded. Upgrading items will require materials which can be acquired through
                        several venues: merchants, monster drops, quest rewards or through Salvaging other items. In 
                        the games that have an upgrade system, I find that after awhile, upgrading becomes either too
                        tedious or too wasteful. I want the player to want to upgrade his or her items as often as 
                        the materials become available.

                    <p>
                        I have always found interesting those stories of discovering cities, long since forgotten, whose
                        culture and people have faded into legend. The best of which are those whose civilization 
                        vanishes with no apparent cause because those are the stories that leave your mind to wander in
                        aimless speculation, free to concoct wild, imaginative reasons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dwarves are also an interesting fictional species, used in countless fantasy stories, from the
                        popular Lord of the Rings trilogy to all sorts of genres of video games. Their origin and 
                        culture vary from fiction to fiction, with a few notable characteristics. I want to build on the
                        stories I have read and played while exploring other areas in as much detail as I can to 
                        expand and shape the species within StoneQuest. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Inspired by Dark Souls, I want to create a deep, complicated and broken story, with holes left
                        to be filled by the player and not by me. The most inspiring stories are those that leave you
                        wanting more, not giving you more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        StoneQuest will having a questing system which will be a useful device for telling my story to
                        players, but it will not be the only device. Items spread across the game, some easy and some
                        difficult to obtain, will somehow tell the player how they fit into my story. Humanoids and 
                        other monsters capable of speech will be used as well.

                        application in Java back in December 2011 in order to introduce myself to game
                        design and mechanics.

                    <p>
                        Sometime during development, I made the decision to create a full, production-quality game 
                        complete with artwork, sound effects and (hopefully) a deep and interesting story.

                    <p>
                        In March 2013, I added full mouse support to the game, allowing for a much richer experience
                        for the player. Prior to that, input was limited to keyboard only, modeling the original Rogue
                        experience.

                        More a matter of convenience than expertise, all of StoneQuest's artwork has been done entirely 
                        by myself.

                        My skills as an artist only go so far and I am seeking a more talented individual to aid me in 
                        this area of development. Those interested may send me an email at 
                        <a href="mailto:mattschwartz@utexas.edu">mattschwartz@utexas.edu</a>. Please include some
                        information about yourself, samples of your work (preferably based on my current artwork) as 
                        well as pricing. I am willing to negotiate pay for quality work.

                    <p>
                        Sound effects are extremely important to the player's immersion into any RPG. I intend to
                        create as many of the sound effects for StoneQuest myself, with help from a friend who
                        is a sound engineer as well as some royalty free sound effects I find online.

                    <p>
                        I hold no responsibility if playing the game causes irreparable damage to your computer (though,
                        that is highly unlikely). Please be aware that <b>mature language</b> may be present in StoneQuest.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I ask that you try the game with an open mind. Since it is still
                        in very early development, it will not be very fun as there is no real objective, yet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There will be <i>plenty</i> of bugs that you will most likely encounter will playing any game
                        in early development. The game will likely crash on you and you may not even know why. If
                        you would like to help me squash any bugs you encounter, you can email me 
                        <a href="mailto:stonequest.bcgames@gmail.com?Subject=Bug%20Report">here</a>. Please be as 
                        descriptive as possible when describing the bug, including any steps to reproduce it; 
                        screenshots can also be helpful. Also, please provide what operating system you were using when 
                        the bug occurred.

                        You can download the most recent iteration of StoneQuest (v 0.7.0a) by downloading the <a href="downloads/StoneQuest.jar" title="downloads/StoneQuest.jar">jar</a>
                        or, if that doesn't work, an <a href="downloads/StoneQuest.exe" title="downloads/StoneQuest.exe">executable</a>,
                        (~13 MB) and running it like you would any executable (i.e., by double clicking it). Please note that this since this is the most recent release that, 
                        while it is updated very frequently, <b>it is highly unstable</b> and may contain new features as well as removed features.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can also download a legacy version of StoneQuest (v 0.6.9a) <a href="downloads/StoneQuest_000609.jar" title="downloads/StoneQuest_000609.jar">here</a>
                        which will no longer be updated. This version of StoneQuest marks the end of the old interface.

                        controls are struck through for reference.

                        I plan to host the source for StoneQuest upon completion. As the project is still in early

                        <a href="mailto:stonequest.bcgames@gmail.com">here</a> and describe your reason for wanting the 
                        source. I will consider releasing the source if I find your reason compelling enough.
